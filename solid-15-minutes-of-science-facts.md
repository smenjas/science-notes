# [A Solid 15 Minutes Of Science Facts (w/ Mark Rober & More!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIcZxal3Fg&ab_channel=TomCarroll)

Inspired by [Austin McConnell's *15 Minutes of Useless
Information*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDcfrpbNorw&ab_channel=AustinMcConnell),
but with more science!

Tom Carroll:
- A million seconds is about two weeks, but a billion seconds is about 32
  years.
- You can relight a candle with the stream of smoke that's left after you blow
  it out.  This is because that smoke is filled with wax vapor, which is what
  candles use for their fuel.  So the flame travels down that smoke and looks
  like it's jumping from the lighter to the wick.

Mark Rober:
- Of the estimated 100 billion people to have lived on planet Earth, more than
  half have died of malaria.
- Assume the Earth is spherical, and that you have a rope that stretches around
  the equator.  To lift that rope one foot off the ground, all the way around,
  you only need to add 2Ï€ feet of rope.  This would be the same for any size
  circle, for example the circumference of a basketball.

Tom Carroll:
- A tomato has around 7,000 more genes than a human.
- Over a quarter of your bones are in your feet.
- Roughly one fifth of all known mammals are bats.
- You shoelaces come undone all the time, because each step you take puts them
  under forces of up to 7G.
- White sand beaches come from the poop of parrot fish, that feed by biting off
  chunks of coral skeletons, and excreting what they can't digest as that
  famous white sand.

Tom Scott:
- Your blood vessels laid end to end would stretch around the Earth three
  times.

---

Tom Carroll:
- Every hour, over 430 quintillion Joules of energy from the Sun hits Earth.
  Humanity doesn't use that much energy in an entire year.
- The heaviest dinosaur was called Argentinosaurus, which weighed in at 60-100
  tons, which is equivalent to about 17 African elephants.

Joe Hanson from It's Okay to Be Smart
- Tiny little jumping spiders can probably see the Moon.

Tom Carroll:
- There are more hydrogen atoms in a teaspoon of water, than there are
  teaspoons of water in the world's oceans.
- If you were to line up all the water molucules in a single teaspoon of water
  in a long line, it would reach around 50 billion km, which is like ten times
  the size of our solar system.

## Tautologies
- Sahara means desert
- Tahoe means Lake
- Galaxy means Milky

- Some species of ants can recongize their reflections in a mirror, so they
  might have some level of self-awareness.
- If you have a room of 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two of them have
  the same birthday.

Patch from TierZoo
- The cookie cutter shark, which normally feeds on whale blubber, bites chunks
  out of the rubber coverings on nuclear submarines sonar arrays.

---

Tom Carroll:
- You have a blind spot at the center of your vision when it's dark.  Rod cells
  are responsible for low light vision, but they're located at the edges of
  your retinas.
- People in the southern hemisphere see the Moon upside-down, compared to the
  northern hemisphere.

Kevin Lieber:
- One sperm contains the data equivalent of 26 3.5" floppy disks.

Tom Carroll:
- All the gold we've ever mined would fit in just over 3 olympic size swimming
  pools.
